### About Me

My name is JiaoYuan. I earned my Bachelor of Engineering degree in Environmental Science and Engineering from Chengdu University of Technology in 2025. Currently, I am pursuing a Master's degree at Sichuan University, specializing in Bioinformatics under the guidance of Professor Tao Ma.My current research interests lie in evolutionary genomics, machine learning, and foundation models for biology.

As a proponent of free software, I have been a dedicated user of [Arch Linux](https://www.archlinux.org/) since 2021. However, due to the demands of my field, I also utilize the Windows operating system. My work primarily involves data analysis using Python and shell scripting.

This blog serves as a repository for my essays, tutorials, and monthly records. You can subscribe to my blog [via RSS](https://jiaoyuan.org/index.xml) or follow the WeChat public account "猫四叔" (Uncle Cat) for the latest updates. You can find me on GitHub at [imjiaoyuan](https://github.com/imjiaoyuan) or reach me via email at imjiaoyuan@gmail.com.
